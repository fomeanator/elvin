# 🕰️ Time Romance — hub, collections, three novel types

Demonstrates the **hub layout** (instead of a carousel) and how three content
"types" — **Expeditions / Dates / Reality Storyline** — are NOT three systems but one
novel + a `type` field + unlock conditions on `global.*` flags. One engine;
each novel has its own visuals and content — all driven by manifest data.

## The full chain

1. **Hub** (`ui.browse.layout = "hub"`) — game title + collection tiles.
2. Tap a collection → **card list**; tap a card → **detail view** (image +
   text + "Play").
3. "Play" on an expedition **spends 1 energy** (`cost`) — not enough → popup → store.
4. A regular novel plays (`exp_victoria.lvns`) with branching and a condition.
5. **The finale sets `global.*` flags** — `exp_victoria_done`, `date_victoria`,
   `reality_beat_2`.
6. The date and the reality beat are gated by these flags in the manifest (`unlock`) — as
   soon as the flag is set, their cards stop being locked.

The expedition script is `exp_victoria.lvns` (compiles, 0 warnings). The flag inside
the expedition (`daring`) is local; the finale flags (`global.*`) are shared per player.

## What is engine here, and what is data

| Engine (shared, one firmware) | Data (each game has its own) |
|---|---|
| the hub renders **any** `collections` | which collections, names, art |
| `type` is a free-form tag, the engine never reads it | `expedition`/`date`/anything |
| `unlock` is an expression over `global.*` | which flag gates the card |
| `cost` charges the wallet | 1 energy / free |
| the finale sets a flag via `set key="global.…"` | which flags, what they unlock |
| screen theme from `ui.browse` | colors, art, texts, shape |

A different novel = different `collections`/`type`/`unlock`/`cost` + a different `ui.browse`
→ different visuals and content, **same firmware**. Expeditions/Dates/Reality
are Time Romance data, not the engine.
